# aenir

## A Fire Emblem stat calculator
> This module lets you perform stat calculations for Fire Emblem units.

With this module, you can:
- Create a virtual copy of a unit and their stats.
- Level up that unit.
- Promote that unit.
- Compare one unit to another.
- And much more!

## Installation

To start, install `aenir`.
```bash
pip install aenir
```

## Usage

Let's begin by starting up an interactive Python shell.
We will start by importing the shortcut function `get_morph`.
```python
from aenir.morph import get_morph
```

To create a virtual copy of a unit (i.e. a 'Morph'), bear in mind the following:

1. The name of the unit; this should have the [SerenesForest.Net](https://serenesforest.net/) spelling.
2. The number of the game the unit is from.

Let's say we want to get Roy's stats. Note that **Roy** is from FE**6**: The Sword of Seals.

```python
roy = get_morph(6, "Roy")
print(roy)
```

As you can see, these stats suck. Let's fix that; let's level him up to level twenty.

```python
num_levels = 20 - roy.current_lv
roy.level_up(num_levels)
print(roy)
```

That's better. But it's still not enough. Let's promote him.

```python
roy.promote()
```

For the fun of it, let's max him out.

```python
num_levels = 19 # because he starts out at level one again.
roy.level_up(num_levels)
# implicit: roy.__repr__()
print(roy)
```
 
Note that when initializing certain characters, like Rutger, extra initialization parameters will be needed. 

```python
rutger = get_morph(6, "Rutger", hard_mode=True)
larcei = get_morph(4, "Larcei", father="Lex")
lyn = get_morph(7, "Lyn", lyn_mode=True)
```

Compare characters by using the greater-than operator.

```python
roy > lyn
print(sum(roy > lyn))
```

## Limitations

Currently, this calculator works only for characters from:

4. Genealogy of the Holy War
5. Thracia 776
6. Sword of Seals
7. Blazing Blade
8. The Sacred Stones
9. Path of Radiance
